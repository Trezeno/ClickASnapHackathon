**Bournemouth University ClickASnap Hackathon**

_6th March 2023 -> 10th March 2023_

This was my input to the team as part of the aforementioned ClickASnap hackathon.
- This webpage was made to visualize what our feature would be doing behind the scenes, to better put our point across.
- It randomly grabs images from the website with a random photo tag they may have (since ClickASnap is the worlds leading photo sharing platform) and displays them one by one to the user to like or pass upon.
- It can also prioritise photos with the tags you have in your liked list, so you can better find photos that would suit your interest, rather than browse a wider variety you may not have come across on your own.
- Alternatively is the option to mix your liked list and random to get a mix of everything as just another way to vary this new feature.
- As you begin to like multiple photos with the same tag, the 'AI' under the hood will essentially add this tag you like to your liked tags list and you're more likely to be shown those photos as the 'AI' has determined you would like these.
- You may freely remove or add any tags you wish to as well, the 'AI' would merely aim to assist you in this.
- The 'AI' is all pure visualization with no real logic behind it, merely to show what our feature may do and how it may be implemented.
- On top of that, our feature would also have the ability to look back on liked photos if you would need to, be it for inspiration or a drawing aid, whatever one might use it for, the option is there.
- The final addition we made was a way to look through the most liked photos of the day, week or month, to show off the top users on the platform and showcase their ability to others that may not have stumbled across it otherwise.

We also managed to develop a working prototype of our photo swipe system which is packaged elsewhere, not currently accessible on my GitHub.
